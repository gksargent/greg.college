  <h2>BS Web Design &amp; Development - Brigham Young University Idaho</h2>
  <p>With an estimated graduation date of spring 2018, I'm looking forward to closing up a decade of working on this degree. I'll use this space to share class projects and practice the development skills learned through this program.</p>
  <p>Everything that you see on this site is hand coded from scratch using php, html, css, sass and javascript. During each semester I find myself scrapping the code for this site and starting over utilizing newly learned methods and languages. Currently everything is modularized through php includes for the markup and sass for the styling.</p>
  <p>This semester I'll be focusing on integrating databases and dynamic content...can't wait!</p>
